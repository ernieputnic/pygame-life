lines of modern Python.

The engine is entirely and purely implemented using vanilla
Python 3.9, and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) is used for
the graphics front.
-->

## Running The Game

It is recommend using the latest version of Python (3.9) on a
separate virtual environment to your normal development one. 
Create a new environment for this game and install the dependencies with:

```shell
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Given that all the dependencies were installed, running the
game is as simple as

```shell
python pygame_life.py
```
<!--
## Understand The Code

The intention was to show that, by keeping it simple, [Conway's Game Of Life 
can be implemented in a few lines of Python](https://matgomes.com/conways-game-of-life-python).
